# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 10000.times do
#   User.create(name: 'test', created_at: "2014-#{rand(1..11)}-#{rand(1..30)}", type_of: ["admin", "plain"].sample, state: [0, 1].sample)
# end
